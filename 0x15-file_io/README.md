# 0x15. C - File I/O

## Resources

- [File descriptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_descriptor)
- [C Programming in Linux Tutorial #024 - open() read() write() Functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-srF6c3TJ8)

### man or help:

- `open`
- `close`
- `read`
- `write`
- `dprintf`

## Learning Objectives

- Look for the right source of information online
- How to create, open, close, read and write files
- What are file descriptors
- What are the 3 standard file descriptors, what are their purpose and what are their `POSIX` names
- How to use the I/O system calls `open`, `close`, `read` and `write`
- What are and how to use the flags `O_RDONLY`, `O_WRONLY`, `O_RDWR`
- What are file permissions, and how to set them when creating a file with the `open` system call
- What is a system call
- What is the difference between a function and a system call

## Requirements

Tip: always prefer using symbolic constants (`POSIX`) vs numbers when it makes sense. For instance `read(STDIN_FILENO, ...` vs `read(0, ...`

## Tasks

### 0. Tread lightly, she is near

Write a function that reads a text file and prints it to the `POSIX` standard output.

- Prototype: `ssize_t read_textfile(const char *filename, size_t letters);`
- where letters is the number of letters it should read and print
- returns the actual number of letters it could read and print
- if the file can not be opened or read, return `0`
- if `filename` is `NULL` return `0`
- if `write` fails or does not write the expected amount of bytes, return `0`

Requiescat
by Oscar Wilde

Tread lightly, she is near
Under the snow,
Speak gently, she can hear
The daisies grow.

All her bright golden hair
Tarnished with rust,
She that was young and fair
Fallen to dust.

Lily-like, white as snow,
She hardly knew
She was a woman, so
Sweetly she grew.

Coffin-board, heavy stone,
Lie on her breast,
I vex my heart alone,
She is at rest.

Peace, Peace, she cannot hear
Lyre or sonnet,
All my life's buried here,
Heap earth upon it.
