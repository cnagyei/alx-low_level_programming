# 0x03. C - Debugging

Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevents it from running correctly. As you become a more advanced programmer and an industry engineer, you will learn how to use debugging tools such as `gdb` or built-in tools that IDEs have. However, it’s important to understand the concepts and processes of debugging manually.

## Tasks

### 0. Multiple mains

In most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a `postitive_or_negative()` function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project: **Task 0 of 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while**

```sh
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ cat main.c
#include "main.h"

/**
* main - tests function that prints if integer is positive or negative
* Return: 0
*/

int main(void)
{
        int i;

        i = 98;
        positive_or_negative(i);

        return (0);
}
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$
```

```sh
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ cat main.h
#ifndef MAIN_H
#define MAIN_H

#include <stdio.h>

void positive_or_negative(int i);

#endif /* MAIN_H */
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ 
```
```sh
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 positive_or_negative.c main.c
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ ./a.out
98 is positive
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$
```

Based on the `main.c` file above, create a file named `0-main.c`. This file must test that the function `positive_or_negative()` gives the correct output when given a case of `0`.

You are not coding the solution / function, you’re just testing it! However, you can adapt your function from 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while - Task #0 to compile with this main file to test locally.

- You only need to upload `0-main.c` and `main.h` for this task. We will provide our own `positive_or_negative()` function.
- You are not allowed to add or remove lines of code, you may change only **one** line in this task.

```sh
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 positive_or_negative.c 0-main.c -o 0-main
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ ./0-main
0 is zero
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ wc -l 0-main.c
16 1-main.c
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$
```

### 1. Like, comment, subscribe

Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

- Don’t add or remove any lines of code, as we will be checking your line count. You are only allowed to comment out existing code.
- You do not have to compile with `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic` for this task.

```sh
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ cat 1-main.c
#include <stdio.h>

/**
* main - causes an infinite loop
* Return: 0
*/

int main(void)
{
        int i;

        printf("Infinite loop incoming :(\n");

        i = 0;

        while (i < 10)
        {
                putchar(i);
        }

        printf("Infinite loop avoided! \\o/\n");

        return (0);
}
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$
```

Your output should look like this:

```sh
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ gcc -std=gnu89 1-main.c -o 1-main
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ ./1-main
Infinite loop incoming :(
Infinite loop avoided! \o/
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ wc -l 1-main.c
24 1-main.c
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$
```
